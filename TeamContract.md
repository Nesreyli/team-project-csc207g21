# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

  * Git changes/problems (errors, implementation)
  * Ideas for the project

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.
    - Equal shared tasks and helping each other when stuck

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
  * If a new idea is presented it will be by unanimous vote by the group

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.
  * If a problem arises we would try to resolve within the group
    * To calm the situation we would try to hear the argument and try to compensate for the issue
  * If the problem continues or escalates we would email or go to the course coordinator to help resolve the problem
---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
  * Helping each other out whoever is available during that time frame if they are stuck or have some misunderstanding in creating the implementation
    * If members can't resolve we should resort to TA's and professors during office hours and labs 
  * Tasks will be split in fair parts both frontend and backend
  * All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations
  * Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
